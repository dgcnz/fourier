#Image processing

##Terminology


###Theorical terms
*__Amplitude__*: It's the instensity in a coordinate (x, y) or *grayscale*
*__Wavelength__*: Distance between the middle of 1 sinusoidal wave to the other
*__Frequency__*: It's meassured in Hertz (Hz) . 1 Hz  equals to 1 cycle of a sinusoidal wave  per second

###Image terms
*__Itensity Resolution__*: Meassure of the number of bits used to encode a pixel
*__Spacial Resolution (dots per inch)__*: The meassure of dots per inch in regards to pixels

###Filtering terms

*__Intensity Transformation__*:  Transformation done in the *spacial domain*, it transforms individual pixels
*__Spatial Filtering__*:  Transformation done in the *frequency domain*, involves the use of a *kernel*




##Key concepts

**Kernel = Mask = Template = Window = Filter Kernel**
**Higher frequency  -> shorter wavelength**
**Intensity = gray level  = monochromatic light**
