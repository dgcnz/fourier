\subsection{Context}

% TODO: Describe fourier transform (use math concepts)

% aplicaciones usando tiempo o espacio a frequency domain.
The Fourier transform, using the fact that change the time or space domain to a frequency domain, has applications in fields as engineering, 


\noindent
A huge part of signals of practice interest can be discompose into a sum of sinusoids, when you work with periodic signals this is called Fourier series and when is aperiodic is called Fourier Transform. \\


\noindent
In this paper, we are going to use Fast Fourier transform to discompose signals of images and voice .
