### **Recent Developments in the Sparse Fourier Transform**

+ Survey
+ Addresses big data setting by computing a compressed Fourier transform, using only a subset of the input data, in time _sublinear_ to the data set size.
+ Sparse Fourier transform algorithms compute an approximation or compressed version of the DFT in time proportional to the sparsity of the spectrum of the signal (i.e., the number of dominant frequencies), as opposed to the length of the signal.
